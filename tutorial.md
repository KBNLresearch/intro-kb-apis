# Introduction to the KB APIs

## Why APIs?

The KB offers access to a large amount of digital content: from books to parliamentary papers and from historical newspapers to medieval illuminated manuscripts. Often users will first encounter these collections through one of several KB websites, such as [Delpher] (http://www.delpher.nl/), [Memory of the Netherlands] (http://www.geheugenvannederland.nl/) or the [Dutch Digital Parliamentary Papers] (http://www.statengeneraaldigitaal.nl/). These website provide a graphical user interface (GUI) with functionality to browse, search, view and download digital objects and their metadata.

Others may want to (re)use some of this content: heritage institutions or commercial parties to develop an alternative user interface that offers new functionality, additional information, or combines data from different sources (e.g. [Europeana] (http://www.europeana.eu/)); Digital Humanities scholars in order to explore their research questions, either by using existing tools or developing their own software. To enable such user groups to programmatically retrieve data in bulk the KB has created a number of data services or APIs (Application Programming Interface).

## What data?

For each digital object in the KB collections, the following metadata and subobjects will typically be available:

- Structural metadata in [MPEG21 DIDL] (http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/mpeg-21) (Digital Item Declaration Language) format. This describes the way in which a composite digital object is structured, containing information about all associated files, such as descriptive metadata, images and full-text objects.

- Descriptive metadata in the [Dublin Core] (http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/) (DC) vocabulary, with some KB-specific extensions (DCX). Here you will find information about title, author, date, language etc.

- One or more [ALTO] (https://www.loc.gov/standards/alto/) files with the content and layout information of each item. This is most often used for applications wanting to highlight specific elements on a page.

- One or more OCR (Optical Character Recognition) files containing the textual content of the item and some information about the structure of the text, such as what the title is and where different paragraphs begin and end.

- One or more images of the object, usually in [JPEG] (https://jpeg.org/jpeg/) format.

Apart form the images, all data is provided in [XML] (https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/) (Extensible Markup Language) format. This is a simple markup language that adds machine-readable structure to textual data by enclosing distinct bits of information between tags. One of the benefits of this data format is that it can be easily read by humans as well.

## KB infrastructure and APIs

The KB infrastructure to handle access to these different types of data consists of three main components:

- The digital objects from the various collections (images, ALTO, OCR) are gathered in a central web storage (KB-WO).

- The different types of metadata associated with these objects (descriptive, structural) are stored seperately in central metadata storage (KB-MDO).

- In order to be able to efficiently search these large data sources the KB builds up a search index from the metadata and full-text objects that are considered most relevant.

Each of these three components can in turn be accessed over the web through its own service: a harvest API to request metadata from the central metadata storage, a search API to query the index, and a resolver to retrieve files from the web storage.

The KB infrastructure was designed in such a way that users need as little foreknowledge as possible in order to use it, by implementing some well-known standards from the cultural heritage domain. Not only for data and metadata, but also for the APIs. That is why the search API is based on the [SRU] (http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/) standard protocol, and the harvest API on [OAI-PMH] (http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/).

## An example data set: ANP Radio Bulletins

In order to get a better idea of the functionality of the various APIs, we will use them to explore the relatively simple data set of [Radio bulletins from the
ANP press agency] (https://www.kb.nl/en/resources-research-guides/data-services-apis/open-data-set-radio-bulletins-anp-press-agency). This set consists of 1.5 million digitized typoscripts from radio news broadcasts between 1937 and 1984. It is one of the collections that are available through the Delpher website, under the name Radiobulletins, and the KB offers the data under (semi) open licenses: for the metadata a [CC0-license] (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) applies, whereas images and full-text objects carry [CC-BY-NC-ND-licenses] (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/deed.en). 

We will first see how some of these files can be obtained through the resolver, and then move on to the details of working with the harvest and search APIs.

## Getting files through the resolver

Like all items from the KB collections, each typoscript from the ANP set is issued with a persistent identifier in the form of a resolver link, such as `http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=anp:1973:10:18:44:mpeg21`. This identifier can be constructed from the persisent link of the typoscript that is shown on its Delpher page by adding the `:mpeg21` suffix. From this identifier the resolver links for the various files associated with the typoscript can be constructed by adding additional suffixes:

- An image of the typoscript can be retrieved from the web storage by adding the `:image` suffix: <br><http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=anp:1973:10:18:44:mpeg21:image>

- The OCR of the typoscript can be retrieved by adding the `:ocr` suffix: <br><http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=anp:1973:10:18:44:mpeg21:ocr>

- And the ALTO file for the typoscript can be retrieved using the `:alto` suffix: <br><http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=anp:1973:10:18:44:mpeg21:alto>

## Exercise 1: Getting files through the resolver

- Navigate to the [Delpher] (http://www.delpher.nl/) website with your browser and search the collection of radio bulletins for a typoscript that interests you. Find the persistent link for this typoscript and construct its unique identifier by adding the `:mpeg21` suffix.

-  Open a new tab or window in your browser and retrieve the image, OCR and ALTO files associated with this typoscript using the `:image`, `:ocr` and `:alto` suffixes. Inspect the results to get an idea of the content and structure of these files.

## Harvest API

Letâ€™s now take a look at the metadata harvest API based on the [OAI-PMH] (http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/) (Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting) protocol. This protocol, created by the Open Archives Initiative, is aimed at retrieving a copy of a data set as a whole, as well as the administrative information needed to keep that copy up to date with the
original set, in case of any changes occurring to the original after the
initial harvest.

A simple request to the harvest API to retrieve the DIDL
structural metadata record for a typoscript from the central metadata
storage is:

<http://services.kb.nl/mdo/oai?verb=GetRecord&identifier=anp:anp:1981:10:14:20:mpeg21&metadataPrefix=didl>

If you look this URL closely, you can see that it is composed of a number of different elements. All requests start with the base URL of the harvest API, being `http://services.kb.nl/mdo/oai`, followed by a question mark. After that, a so-called query string appears, containing a number of URL parameters with the details of the request. The parameters take the form of field-value pairs, separated by ampersand signs. 

First, the operation that is to be performed, called `verb` according to the OAI protocol, needs to be specified, which in this case is `GetRecord` to retrieve a
single metadata record. Next, the unique identifier `anp:anp:1981:10:14:20:mpeg21` of the requested object needs to be supplied, which is inserted with the `identifier` parameter. The identifier used here consists only of the final part of the persistent resolver identifier (after `urn=`) for the typoscript, to which the prefix `anp:` is then added to indicate the specific metadata set we are harvesting from. Finally, the `didl` metadata format we would like to retrieve is requested with the parameter `metadataPrefix`.

The [response] (responses/oai_get_record.xml) to this request will be an XML file starting with some general information about the request, followed by the actual DIDL metadata record. Note that the descriptive metadata for the typoscript is embedded in a block of the structural metadata, whereas other data types can be retrieved using resolver links.

## Exercise 2: Getting started with OAI-PMH

- Open a new window or tab in your browser and navigate to the harvest API base URL. Now construct the parameters for retrieving the DIDL structural metadata record for the typoscript of your choice.

- Inspect the data returned. In particular, identify the different blocks or components that are included in the response, giving an overview of all data associated with this particular typoscript and the ways in which to obtain them.

## OAI-PMH verbs

In addition to the `GetRecord` verb the OAI-PMH standard incorporates five
more verbs that can be used to perform other operations:

- `Identify` will retrieve general information about a repository, such as its name and the version of the OAI-PMH protocol supported: <br/><http://services.kb.nl/mdo/oai?verb=Identify>

- `ListSets` will retrieve the names of the various data sets present in the repository: <br><http://services.kb.nl/mdo/oai?verb=ListSets>

- `ListMetadataFormats` will retrieve the metadata formats available from a repository. An optional identifier argument restricts the request to the formats available for a specific item: <br><http://services.kb.nl/mdo/oai?verb=ListMetadataFormats&identifier=anp:anp:1981:10:14:20:mpeg21>

- `ListRecords` will retrieve all metadata records from the specified set in the specified format. The optional `from` parameter can be used to selectively harvest records that were added to the set after a particular date: <br><http://services.kb.nl/mdo/oai?verb=ListRecords&set=anp&metadataPrefix=didl&from=2005-01-01>

- `ListIdentifiers` will retrieve only the identifiers of all items available from the specified set in the specified format. The optional `from` parameter can be used here as well: <br><http://services.kb.nl/mdo/oai?verb=ListIdentifiers&set=anp&metadataPrefix=didl>

Note that the OAI-PMH syntax is case sensitive. The order in which the
parameters are inserted, however, is not important: different orderings
will all yield the same results. In case a request cannot be processed
for some reason, an error message will be returned that will usually
provide some information about the nature of the problem that occurred.

## Harvesting an entire set

Since sets in an OAI-PMH repository are often quite large, and even a sinlge metadata records can contain a lot of information, harvesting an entire set will
typically be performed incrementally, in a number of smaller steps. First, all identifiers for the set are harvested. By default, only the first 400 identifiers are returned in the initial response of a `ListIdentifiers` request, such as this one:

<http://services.kb.nl/mdo/oai?verb=ListIdentifiers&set=anp&metadataPrefix=didl>

In the [response] (responses/oai_list_identifiers.xml) for this initial request a so-called resumption token will be included at the end, such as
`anp!2008-09-24T09:09:16.332Z!!didl!2317275`. This token can be added to a
new request with the `resumptionToken` parameter, without the need to
specify the set name and metadata format again, like this:

<http://services.kb.nl/mdo/oai?verb=ListIdentifiers&resumptionToken=anp!2008-09-24T09:09:16.332Z!!didl!2317275>

This new request will retrieve the next 400 identifiers, along with new resumption token. This step can be repeated until the identifiers for the entire
set have been harvested, in which case no new resumption token will be
present in the response.

The resulting list of identifiers can now be used to retrieve the full metadata record for each item by issuing `GetRecord` requests for each individual identifier. Finally, if needed, any files associated with the item can be downloaded using the resolver links from the DIDL record.

## Exercise 3: Harvesting a set with OAI-PMH

- Go back to the browser tab or window containing the `GetRecord` request from the previous exercise. Adjust the query string to get some general information about the KB-MDO repository, using verbs such as `Identify`, `ListSets` and `ListMetadataFormats`.

- Now enter the URL to harvest the first 400 identifiers from the ANP set. Find the resumption token at the end of the response and use it to request the next 400 identifiers. Repeat this step a few of times to get an idea of how a piece of software could automatically harvest the identifiers for an entire set by means of this mechanism.

## Search API

If you do not wish to retrieve an entire set, but are more interested in
getting results for a particular search query, you can use the search API. The search API is based on [SRU] (http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/) (Search and Retrieval via URL), a standard protocol for performing search queries on an index and retrieving the results. It uses [CQL] (https://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/cql/) (Contextual Query Language), another standard, as its query language, and is currently maintained by the Library of Congress.

A simple request to the search API for querying the ANP collection with a single  keyword looks like this:

<http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&x-collection=ANP&query=nobelprijs>

As with a request to the harvest API, the request URL is composed of a
base URL, followed by a question mark and a query string containing a
number of parameters. The base URL for the search API is `http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru`. As a first parameter the `operation` that is to be performed is specified, which in this case is `searchRetrieve` for a regular search query. We are searching the collection of digitized typoscripts, which is indicated with the `x-collection` parameter. Collections present in the index may have a name that is different form the set name in the metadata repository. Here, the collection name is `ANP`, in capitals, and the SRU syntax, like OAI-PMH, is case sensitive. Finally, the keyword we are interested in searching is `nobelprijs`, which
is thus entered after the `query` field.

The [response] (responses/sru_search_retrieve.xml) to this request will contain the search results in XML format, along with some general information about the request, such as the version of the SRU protocol being used, the time it took to process the request, and the total number of search results found.

## Other SRU parameters

The SRU standard protocol includes a number of other parameters and parameter values that can be used to further tune the response returned. Also, the KB has implemented some extensions to the protocol to enable additional functionality. Parameters that are part of this extension can be recognized by the `x-` prefix.

- With the `operation` parameter set to `explain`, some general information about the service can be obtained: <br><http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru?operation=explain>

- By default, the first 20 search results are returned. This number can be adjusted with the `maximumRecords` parameter: <br><http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&x-collection=ANP&query=nobelprijs&maximumRecords=100>

- If you want to start viewing the result set from a particular record onwards, you can use the `startRecord` parameter: <br><http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&x-collection=ANP&query=nobelprijs&startRecord=100>

- If you want to add particular bits of information to the display, you can use the `x-fields` parameter. The OCR, for example, can be added by entering the value `content` in this field. Multiple values an be entered as well, separated by commas. To view all available information simply enter `*` here: <br><http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&x-collection=ANP&query=nobelprijs&x-fields=content,volgnummer>

- By default, the Dublin Core descriptive metadata is displayed, but with the `recordSchema` parameter other types of metadata, such as the DIDL, may be retrieved, if available: <br><http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&x-collection=ANP&query=nobelprijs&recordSchema=didl>

## Exercise 4: Querying the index with SRU

- Open a new window or tab in your browser and navigate to the search API base URL. Now construct the parameters for querying the ANP collection with a single keyword of your choice. Find the total number of results for your query.

- Use the `maximumRecords`, `startRecord` and `x-fields` parameters to expand and navigate through the results.

## CQL query syntax

As was mentioned already, the SRU standard protocol uses CQL as its
query language. With the CQL query syntax more elaborate queries can be
formed.

- To search of a string consisting of multiple words, enter the string between double quotes as the query parameter value: <br>[http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&x-collection=ANP&query="nobelprijs literatuur"] (http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&x-collection=ANP&query=%22nobelprijs+literatuur%22)

- For an OR- or AND-query consisting of two terms, simply use the words `OR` or `AND` between the search terms, surrounded by spaces: <br> [http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&x-collection=ANP&query=nobelprijs AND literatuur] (http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&x-collection=ANP&query=nobelprijs+AND+literatuur)

- Wildcards in the form of an asterisk sign `*` are also supported when appearing in the middle or at the end of a keyword: <br><http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&x-collection=ANP&query=nobelpr*>

- To restrict the search to a particular field, add the field name before the search term. This option is only available for specific fields for the ANP collection, such as `date` and `volgnummer`: <br><http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&x-collection=ANP&query=date=01-01-1960>

- To restrict the search to a specific period in time, use the `within` syntax in combination with the `date` field: <br>[http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&x-collection=ANP&query=date within "01-01-1960 01-01-1961"] (http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&x-collection=ANP&query=date+within+%2201-01-1960+01-01-1961%22)

When constructing these more elaborate queries, you have to be careful to properly encode certain characters, such as spaces, that may not appear as part of an URL. This means replacing these characters with a code: a space should be
replaced by `%20` or `+`, for example, and a double quotation mark with `%22`. Many modern browsers will automatically take care of this encoding for
you, but if you run into any problems, you can find the required code
for such characters and have your query encoded for you at the [URL Encoding Reference] (http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp).

## Faceting with SRU

A final interesting aspect of the SRU search API is the capability
for faceting the search results by period. A query for faceting the
search results by year, for example, is:

<http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&x-collection=ANP&query=nobelprijs&maximumRecords=0&x-facetprefix=1&x-facetname=periode&x-facets=indexes:ANPfacets:periode>

The `maximumRecords` parameter has been set to 0 here, so that only the
facetted results are present in the [response] (responses/sru_search_facets.xml). The `x-facetprefix` parameter can take values
from 0 to 3, resulting in different temporal resolutions of the facet
(where 0=decade, 1=year, 2=month, and 3=day). The `x-facetname` and `x-facets`
parameters are needed to indicate the particular facet requested.

The period facet can be filtered as well. If you want facets with a
resolution of a month, but you are only interested in the decade
1950-1959, the query would be:

[http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&x-collection=ANP&query=nobelprijs&maximumRecords=0&x-facetprefix=2&x-facetname=periode&x-facets=indexes:ANPfacets:periode&x-filter=periode
exact "0/1950-1959/"] (http://jsru.kb.nl/sru/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&x-collection=ANP&query=nobelprijs&maximumRecords=0&x-facetprefix=2&x-facetname=periode&x-facets=indexes:ANPfacets:periode&x-filter=periode+exact+%220%2F1950-1959%2F%22)

Again, don't forget to properly encode the special characters that are part of the `periode exact "0/1950-1959/"` value of the `x-filter` parameter here, if your browser does not do this automatically. The encoded version of this value is `periode+exact+%220%2F1950-1959%2F%22`.

## Exercise 5: Advanced SRU options

- Experiment with the CQL query language to form more elaborate queries. Search for a string consisting of multiple keywords, for example, and filter the results by selecting a particular date range.

- Note the URL encoding that your browser applies to the query (or, if your browser does not offer this functionality, the URL encoding that is returned by the [URL Encoding Reference] (http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp)).

- Create a faceted view of a result set of your choice by using the `x-facets`, `x-facetname` and `x-facetprefix` parameters.

## Other KB data sets

The KB offers access to many other collections besides the ANP radio
bulletins through its APIs. Although the data available may vary
somewhat across collections, the use of the APIs as described here will
be the same for every collection. Other collections may be a bit more complex to work with if objects with a hierarchical structure, such as a newspaper issue comprising multiple pages and articles, are involved. However, for several such collections detailed technical instructions are available from the [Data Services] (<https://www.kb.nl/en/resources-research-guides/data-services-apis>) page of the KB website to help you get started.

Please note that not all collections are available as open data sets, so if you want to use a copyright-protected collection, please contact us first to discuss the possibilities. It may be necessary to draw up a contract stating the allowed use of the dataset, or to obtain a so-called API key that can be used to gain access to restricted materials.

## Exercise 6: Moving on to other sets

-   Visit the [Data Services] (<https://www.kb.nl/en/resources-research-guides/data-services-apis>) page of the KB website and take a look at the open datasets that are available.
-   Open the technical instructions for a dataset of your choice and try it out with the search and harvest APIs.

## Questions?

If you have any questions about a particular data set or run into
problems while using the APIs, you can always contact us using the KB
Digital Humanities mailbox at <dh@kb.nl>.
